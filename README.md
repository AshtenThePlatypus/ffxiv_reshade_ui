# ffxiv_reshade_ui

**Important: Still under development. Not currently in a working state. Please see development branch if you'd like to try it out anyways.**

This plugin grabs inspiration from the PunishXIV Pictomancer mod in order to communicate UI positioning for use in the keep_ui ReShade plugin. Included is a modified version of that ReShade shader to use the UI mask provided by the plugin.

## How to build and install:
